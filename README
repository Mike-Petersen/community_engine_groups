CommunityEngine Groups
======================
 
This is a CommunityEngine plugin. It's designed to work with the CommunityEngine social networking platform, and won't work unless CE is properly installed.

NOTE: This plugin is in super-alpha-please-be-careful-with-me form. It's very rough, but hopefully will help give people an idea of how to develop CE plugins, and develop into a more mature groups functionality for CE.

YOUR HELP IS NEEDED TO IMPROVE THIS PLUGIN! Please fork it, add tests, add documentation, add code, and send me pull requests. Thanks,
Bruno
